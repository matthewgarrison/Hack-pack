General graph algorithms.

\subsection*{BFS and DFS}

\subsection*{Toposort}

Khan's algorithm: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Take all the vertexes with indegree 0 and put them into a queue.
    \item Remove a vertex and subtract the indegree of all its neighbors by 1. If any of those neighbors now have indegree 0, add them to the queue.
    \item Repeat until the queue is empty.
\end{itemize}

You can use a PriorityQueue (sorting on index) to get the lexographically first toposort.

\subsection*{Two-coloring}

\textit{Runtime: O(n)}

Works in Bipartite graphs.
