\startsection{Longest common subsequence/substring}

\subsection*{Longest common subsequence}

This problem finds the longest common subsequence between two strings. To find just the length (stored in \inline{memo[a.length()][b.length()]}, where \inline{a} and \inline{b} are \inline{char[]}):

\lstinputlisting{algorithms/code/longestcommon1.java}

Space-saving version, if all you need is the length (answer in \inline{memo[1][b.length]} and \inline{b} contains the shorter string):

\lstinputlisting{algorithms/code/longestcommon2.java}

To find the LCS itself:

\lstinputlisting{algorithms/code/longestcommon3.java}

If that doesn't work, use this recursive method:

\lstinputlisting{algorithms/code/longestcommon4.java}

If thereâ€™s more than one possible LCS, use this method:

\lstinputlisting{algorithms/code/longestcommon5.java}

To find the LCS of $n$ Strings, you need an n\textsuperscript{th} dimensional array.

\subsection*{Longest common substring}

The answer is in \inline{memo[1][b.length]} and \inline{b} contains the shorter string.

\lstinputlisting{algorithms/code/longestcommon6.java}
