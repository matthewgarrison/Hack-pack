[Add applications of flow here]

\subsection*{Dinic's}

Runtime: O($V^2 E$) \\
\indent In graphs where every edge has a capacity of 1, the runtime is O($min(V^{2/3}, E^{1/2}) E$) \\
\indent In graphs where "each vertex, except for source and sink, either has a single entering edge of capacity one, or a single outgoing edge of capacity one, and all other capacities are arbitrary integers", the runtime is O($\sqrt{V} E$). This includes graphs arising from bipartite matching problems.
