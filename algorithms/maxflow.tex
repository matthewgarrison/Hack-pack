Max flow is...

\subsection*{Dinic's}

\textit{Runtime: O(V\textsuperscript{2}E)} \\
\indent In graphs where every edge has a capacity of 1, the runtime is \textit{O(min\{V\textsuperscript{2/3}, E\textsuperscript{1/2}\} E)} \\
\indent In graphs where "each vertex, except for source and sink, either has a single entering edge of capacity one, or a single outgoing edge of capacity one, and all other capacities are arbitrary integers", the runtime is \textit{O($\sqrt{\text{V}}$ E)}. This includes graphs arising from bipartite matching problems.
