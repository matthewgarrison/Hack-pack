\textit{Runtime: O(n log(n))}

\inline{LEN} is the length of the arrays. \inline{LEN} must be at least double the degree of the polynomials being multiplied and a power of 2. 

NOTE: The polynomial must be \textit{exactly} the one you wish to use. For example, if you are raising a polynomial to the k\textsuperscript{th} power, and you only care about indexes less than 50000, you must zero out all the indexes past 50000.

Also, if you're squaring a polynomial, you can remove a \inline{fft()} call by multiplying \inline{ar} and \inline{ai} by themselves.
