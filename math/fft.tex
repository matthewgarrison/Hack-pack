\inline{LEN} is the length of the arrays. \inline{LEN} must be at least double the degree of the polynomials being multiplied and a power of 2. You can use \inline{Integer.highestOneBit(n) << 2} to find \inline{LEN}.

If you're squaring a polynomial, you can remove a \inline{fft()} call by multiplying \inline{ar} and \inline{ai} by themselves. If you're raising a polynomial to the k\textsuperscript{th} power, it's faster to have \inline{n==0} return \inline{null} and put a special case into the \inline{multiply()} method.
