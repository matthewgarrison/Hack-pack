\subsection*{Sieve of Eratosthenes}

\textit{Runtime: O(n log(log(n)))}

The Sieve of Erastosthenes computes primes by “marking off” multiples of all the primes before the current prime. The limit of how large a number you can check with this is based on how large an array you can make. However, you can “double” the max number by using a Sieve that only checks odd numbers. If you need a really large sieve, use a BitSet.

You can count the number of prime factors a number has by changing lines 5-7 to:

(A number i is prime if \inline{numPrimeFactors[i]} is 0.)

\subsection*{Totient sieve}

This can also be used as a prime sieve, because \inline{p} is prime if \inline{phi[p] == p-1}.

\subsection*{Mod inverse sieve}

The modular inverse of \inline{i} \textit{mod} \inline{m}.
